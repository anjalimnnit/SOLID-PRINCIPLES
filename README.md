# SOLID-PRINCIPLES
Whenever we write code in any object oriented programming language we need to take care of certain points for effective code. Therefore there are five principles given by Robert C.Martin popularly known as uncle Bob. By following these principles we can make our code loosely coupled. The five principles are :
## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
## Open/Closed Principle
## Liskovâ€™s Substitution Principle (LSP)
## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

In this folder we will have a look at all the principles separately.
